/***Description:**  
This SQL file includes examples of how to manage data within the `nyins.PlanSplits` table. It covers inserting new rows, updating existing values, deleting specific records, and handling ordering issues when the primary key is stored as a `VARCHAR`. Each example uses `BEGIN TRAN` so changes can be tested safely before committing.

**Included Queries:**
- **Order by numeric value (when SplitId is a VARCHAR)**
- **Delete a specific PlanSplit row**
- **Update a PlanSplit percentage**
- **Insert a new PlanSplit record***/

/*Note: Run each query one section at a time.
  Use BEGIN TRAN to preview the changes before committing them.
  If the table looks correct, go ahead and COMMIT.
  If something doesnâ€™t look right, you can ROLLBACK to restore the table to its original state.
