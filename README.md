Each example uses `BEGIN TRAN` so changes can be tested safely before committing.

## ðŸ“‚ plan_splits_with_house_account.sql

This script ensures every plan in `PlanSplits` includes a "HOUSE" account (EmployeeId 16) so that all splits total exactly 100%.

We remove existing HOUSE rows first because not all of them are correct â€” some don't fill the full gap to 100%. Then we calculate the true remainder per plan and re-add HOUSE with the correct value.

---

### What It Does
- Removes current HOUSE rows.
- Sums remaining splits per plan.
- Re-adds HOUSE:
  - If splits exist â†’ fills the gap.
  - If no splits â†’ HOUSE gets 100%.
- Returns all splits, now totaling 100% per plan.

---

### Key CTEs
- `RemoveHouse`: Excludes existing HOUSE rows.
- `HouseInsert`: Adds correct HOUSE entry per plan.

---

### Output
PlanId, PlanName, EmployeeId, FirstName, LastName, SplitPercentage, EffectiveDate
